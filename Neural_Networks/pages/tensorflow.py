The code defines a simple neural network model to classify \
    handwritten digits. The model consists of the following layers:

Flatten: This layer takes the 28x28 pixel input image and transforms \
    it into a one-dimensional array of 784 elements.
Dense (128 units): This is a fully connected layer with 128 neurons. \
    It applies a weighted sum to the input and passes it through the \
        ReLU activation function, introducing non-linearity.
Dropout: This layer randomly deactivates 20% of the neurons during \
    training to prevent overfitting.
Dense (10 units): The final fully connected layer with 10 neurons, \
    one for each digit class. It applies a softmax activation function, \
        producing a probability distribution over the possible output classes.
In essence, the model takes an image, flattens it, processes it \
    through two layers of neurons, and then outputs a probability \
        distribution representing its prediction for which digit \
            the image contains.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, which is known for \
    its efficient training, and the sparse categorical crossentropy \
        loss function, suitable for multi-class classification \
            problems with integer labels. The model's accuracy \
                is tracked during training.

The final test accuracy of **97.91%** indicates that the model \
    performs well on unseen data, successfully classifying \
        handwritten digits with high accuracy.

Twitter Classification Project

Overview

This project is designed to create a classification algorithm that can classify any tweet (or sentence) and predict whether that sentence came from New York, London, or Paris. The goal is to provide insights into how natural language processing can be used to classify text data.

Requirements

To use this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as Jupyter Notebooks. You can install these tools through Anaconda or VS Code, or use Google Colab and import your files through a mounted Google Drive.

Features

This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including the use of scikit-learn (sklearn) and pandas libraries in Python. Jupyter Notebooks are used to run the code and present the analysis in an interactive and easy-to-understand manner.

Usage

To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred Python environment. Run the code cells sequentially to see the results of the analysis.

Known Issues and Limitations

It's important to note that some things can be said the same way in different countries, and other things are often a difference of language. Therefore, users should be as specific as possible when using this classification algorithm on their own data.

Contributions and Feedback

This project was originally inspired by codecademy.com, and any feedback or contributions are welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the repository page. Thank you for using this project!

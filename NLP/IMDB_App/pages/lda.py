Latent Dirichlet Allocation \
    (pronounced *lay-tent deer-ish-lay al-oh-kay-shun*) \
        is a method to uncover hidden themes or topics \
            in a collection of documents. \
                Think of it as a way to automatically \
                    group movie reviews based on similar subjects.

LDA is useful when:
* You have a large collection of text data (like movie reviews).
* You want to understand the main themes or topics within the data.
* You don't know beforehand what those themes might be (LDA discovers them for you).

LDA produces topics as lists of words.  \

REVIEW_ONE = "How this character ever got hired by the post office is far \
    beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. \
        There is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post \
            office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is \
                probably the point of the movie. How they could go their \
                    entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling. \
                        I didn't take this movie too seriously but it \
                            was so stupid. Then he tries to start the \
                                car without his keys? Lots of horrible \
                                    scenes and horrible acting and this \
                                        movie is not funny at all. It's \
                                            just a sad stupid mess. I \
                                                liked the moms dress \
                                                    though.<br /><br />\

REVIEW_TWO = "When this cartoon first aired I was under the impression that \
    it would be at least half way descent, boy was I wrong. I must admit \
        watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and \
            Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I watched a few \
                episodes and two of them had Batman literally get his ass \
                    kicked left and right by the Penguin who fought like Jet \
                        Li and beat the crap out of Batman and I watched \
                            another episode where Batman got his butt kicked \
                                again by the Joker, who apparently was using \
                                    Jackie Chan moves while flipping in the air \
                                        like a ninja. Since when were the Joker or \
                                            the Penguin ever a match for Batman ? \
                                                and worse yet when were Joker and \
                                                    Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of \
                                                        Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's \
                              truly embarrassing, depressing and sad the \
                                  way the image of Batman is portrayed \
                                      in this show. The animation is awful \
                                          and the dialog is terrible. Being a \
                                            Batman fan since my boyhood I can \
                                                honestly and strongly advise \
                                                    you to stay away and avoid \
                                                        this show at all cost, \
                                                            because it doesn't \
                           project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a \
                               wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really wanna see a classic \
                                   Batman cartoon I strongly recommend Batman the Animated \
                                       Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece \
                                           of S---T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and don't \
                                               waste your time with this cartoon."

REVIEW_THREE = 'Good, funny, straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman \
    (I almost always like the movies she\'s in). This was a good "vehicle" for \
        someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both. A \
            romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, great closing lines. \
                Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good, but unpopular \
                    romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they\'re too \
            implausible. Ebert didn\'t even post a review for this. The great \
                "screwball" comedies obviously were totally implausible ("Bringing up \
                    Baby", etc.). If you\'ve seen one implausible comedy, you\'ve seen \
                        them all? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. \
                            Weird. Birthday Girl is a movie I\'ve enjoyed several times. \
                                Nicole Kidman may be the "killer app" for home video.'

Titanic Project
This project uses machine learning and binary classification to find out the chances of someone's survival based on gender, age, and whether or not they were first or second class citizens on the Titanic.

Data
The data for this project comes from the Kaggle Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about 891 passengers who were on board the Titanic when it sank. The data includes information about passengers' names, ages, genders, cabins, and whether or not they survived.

Tools
The tools that were used for this project include:

Python
Jupyter Notebooks
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Findings
The findings of this project show that factors such as gender, age, and cabin location were important determinants of survival. The project also shows that there were significant differences in survival rates between different social classes.

For example, Jack Dawson, a male passenger in third class, had a 12% chance of survival. Rose DeWitt Bukater, a female passenger in first class, had a 95% chance of survival. If the author of this project were on the ship, they would have had a 26% chance of survival.

Next Steps
The next steps for this project include expanding the analysis to include more data and using machine learning to predict survival.

# preprogrammed answers
response_a = "My name is Domenick. I am a 27 years old, dog loving, U.S. Army veteran.\nMy strengths are in communication, organization, and time management.\n\
My weaknesses are hyper fixation, often have issues balancing aspects of my life \n\
(for example, I have been having so much fun learning to code, I stopped doing everythng else), \n\
and I find it hard to work on anything without some background music or sounds."
response_b = "I began coding in January of 2020 while attending Florida Polytechnic University.\n\
My first language was C then C++, due to the Pandemic I ended up learning online and for personal reasons, \n\
I left the University for online learning through Codecademy.com.\nInitally I focused on backend development but decided to try data science one day and have been\
hooked ever since!\nIt was March of 2022 when I started completeing courses on Codecademy.com, using youtube, stackoverflow, and Reddit to expand my skills.\n\
I do not know everything, but I know how to find the answer and learn almost anything!"
response_c = "Data Science is important to me because with it, I feel I am apart of something bigger. \n\
To be apart of anything in the realm of data science, I am, in a small way, helping to further the advancement of the field.\n\
While the job I have may not seem to be apart of the forwarding of Data Science, to me, it is. It nutures and refines the skills in my mind.\n\
Every line I write gives me the chance to think of something unique in how I approach a problem that I may one day be able to share with the community."
response_d = "This may be hard to answer. What makes me unique? Well.. the way I have led my life up until now, in short. \n\
I like to think I see the world in a way very few might. I bring everything from my experience as a Signal Analyst \n\
in the army to my days washing dishes in highschool\n\
to the table. Every problem I solve is impacted by my past teachings, experience, and motivation for growth.\n\
If the answer is out there, I will find it. I will use my resources for the benefit of the company I work for and to challenge myself daily."
